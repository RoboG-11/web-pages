# web-pages
This repository has some web pages that I have made.

### In the [WebAnime](https://github.com/RoboG-11/web-pages/tree/main/WebAnime) repository
Found a web page that contains a list of 9 anime in no particular order.

This is a gif showing the content of the page:

There is a small exercise from the [frontendmentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) page.
